# In freshwater lakes, ebullition is an important pathway for biogenic methane and many other gases which are stated below to escape from sediment and reach the atmosphere.
# Gas ebullition from lakes is a process where the gases are transported from the lake sediment to atmosphere as a form of bubbling or boiling.
# The gas which commonly found during ebullition is Methane, Carbon dioxide, Nitrous oxide, Argon, Nitrogen and Oxygen. Most of the researchers are working in finding the various aspects of gas ebullition in various lakes and rivers. 
# The main objective of this research work is to find out the various gases which are released by lakes and rivers and to quantify them.
